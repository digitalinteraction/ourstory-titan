# Our Story Titan Installer

Our Story depends on a technology called Virtualisation on Windows. If you are unsure whether your computer supports the never version (Called HyperV), download the `Toolbox` installer.

> Most computers with Windows 10 Pro, Education or Enterprise will have this support enabled.

Download the following files in this directory onto your machine or USB stick:

- [images.tar](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bootleggerlive/titan/images.tar)
- [For Toolbox](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bootleggerlive/titan/OurStoryToolbox.exe) or [For HyperV](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bootleggerlive/titan/OurStoryHyperV.exe)

Run the installer. You should not require internet connectivity, if you have both the above files.
